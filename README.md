# What's in My Food Project Prototype

"What‚Äôs in My Food" is an AI-powered app designed to empower Indian consumers with transparency about food safety. It scans and analyzes food labels, identifying harmful ingredients, allergens, and regulatory non-compliance, enabling informed dietary decisions.

## Problem Statement 

As health consciousness rises globally, Indian consumers are increasingly demanding transparency about the ingredients in their food. However, the Indian market often lacks accountability, exposing consumers to harmful ingredients like allergens, unsafe additives, and banned substances.

With the increasing prevalence of food-related health issues, there‚Äôs an urgent need for a reliable solution to identify harmful ingredients and allergens in food products. Existing solutions in the market, like Sift, Yuka, and Fooducate, primarily cater to US markets and focus on lifestyle features like weight loss or cosmetic products.

Key Issues Identified:

  * India-specific concerns, including unsafe food additives and allergens.
  * Limited personalization options in existing apps.
  * Static databases without real-time updates or AI-driven insights.
  * Lack of security focused apps prioritizing consumer safety over lifestyle features.

## Project Vision 
To empower Indian consumers to make informed decisions about their diet and health by providing a transparent, AI-driven food analysis app.


## Key Features

1. Health Risk Alerts: Flags allergens, unsafe additives, and banned substances.
2. Personalization: Tailors insights to individual sensitivities (e.g., gluten intolerance).
3. Nutritional Analysis: Highlights products exceeding dietary guidelines.
4. Simple Scoring: Alphabetical gradings for easy understanding.
5. Blockchain Backed Rewards System to keep users coming back!
